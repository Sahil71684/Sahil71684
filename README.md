# Sequoia Resurrection
**macOS Sequoia (15 Beta) running on a Late 2013 MacBook Pro ‚Äì Fully Functional ‚ÄúGod Mode‚Äù Setup**

![screenshot](https://your-image-link.com) <!-- Optional: Add real screenshot later -->

## Overview

This project documents the successful installation and full operation of macOS 15 Sequoia on an **unsupported MacBook Pro 15-inch (Late 2013)**, model **MacBookPro11,3**, using OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP). Contrary to Apple's official support list, this machine now runs Sequoia **flawlessly**, complete with full system acceleration, App Store, and root access.

> **First Fully Stable Sequoia Install on MacBookPro11,3? Possibly. Definitely worth bragging.**

## What Was Done

- **Used OpenCore Legacy Patcher** to spoof model ‚Üí `MacBookPro16,1`
- Installed macOS Sequoia from USB Installer
- Mounted EFI at `disk0s1` and patched OpenCore manually
- Disabled:
  - System Integrity Protection (SIP)
  - Secure Boot
  - FileVault
  - Apple Mobile File Integrity (AMFI)
- Enabled full **root-level customizations**
- Fixed missing system apps (Pages, Keynote, Numbers)
- Installed third-party tweaks (MacForge-ready)
- Performance is **buttery smooth**, with no graphical glitches

---

## Why It Matters

- Apple officially blocks Sequoia on Macs older than 2018
- This Mac was not supposed to support even Ventura natively
- Yet here it is, running the **latest beta like a modern M1**
- **No kernel panics, no hacks breaking updates, just smooth power**
